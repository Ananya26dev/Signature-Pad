# Generate Digital Signature

In a React JS project using react-signature-canvas, the Digital Signature Generator allows users to draw signatures on a canvas.
The project involves:

- Signature Canvas: Users can sign directly using a responsive signature pad.
- Capture and Save: The drawn signature is captured as an image or data URL for further use (e.g., saving, sending).
- Clear and Redraw: Users can clear the canvas to re-sign as needed.

This project is ideal for creating smooth, real-time digital signatures in forms or agreements.
